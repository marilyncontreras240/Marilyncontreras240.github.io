                <h2>Sound Power</h2>
                <p>In art as a class we had to come up with very powerful words. Then our teacher Ms.Dudik printed the words and cut them out and put it in a basket. After that we had to choose ten words. We all had to do a statement with the words that we choose. 
                <p>My statement was "live alone". The reason I decided to do this statement was because alot of people can relate to it.This statement is powerful because Here “ live alone “ means living to have sovereignty of yourself, to have freedom. It means  not to be dragged away by the past, not to be in fear of the future, and not to be  pulled around by the circumstances of the present. We are always master of ourselves, we can grasp the situation as it is, and we are sovereign of the situation and of ourselves. 

                <p>

                <h2></h2>
                <p>  I used black and white to add to the overall meaning of the statement These colors add to the overall meaning of the statement because white symbolizes  purity, innocence, wholeness and completion. In this statement it is representing “Live”.Black portrays evil, depressing, scary and even death. Here the color represents “Alone”.</p>

                <h2></h2>
                <p>If I were to rework this project, I could’ve improved the neatness of the painting.  I tried to be careful with my work but people just kept messing me up.  I think the lines could’ve been more straight and I believe I could’ve added more detail in my work.  If I could do this project again the only thing I  would change would be not painting but to do collage instead.  Im really bad at painting  Through this project I learned that a lot Iof people have really good statements  and each one of them have a unique meaning behind it. (Words can be really powerful).
