                <h2>Meaning</h2>
                <p>I choose to color it red, white and black because red represent the color of fire and blood, so it is associated with energy, war, danger, strength, power, determination as well as passion, desire, and love.White represents  light, goodness, innocence, purity, and virginity. It is considered to be the color of perfection. Black is associated with power, elegance, formality, death, evil, and mystery.
